# Weather App

This project is for practicing async/await in JavaScript. It is part of The Odin Project course: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-weather-app.

It calls the OpenWeatherMap.org API. For now, I am just console logging the response. May refactor later to actually display the response on the page.
